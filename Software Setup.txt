 Software Setup (CRITICAL!)
This is where most people fail. Read carefully.

Step 1: Install Arduino IDE & Libraries

Download & Install Arduino IDE 2.x.
Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries.
Search for FastLED (by Daniel Garcia) and install it.
Step 2: Board Settings (The "Audio Trap")

The audio engine requires a specific core version to run without glitches.

Board Manager: Search for esp32 by Espressif.
👉 DOWNGRADE: Select Version 2.0.17 from the dropdown list and install. Do NOT use Version 3.0.x!
Select Board: ESP32S3 Dev Module.
Step 3: Tools Menu Settings

Set these exactly as shown to avoid boot loops:

Flash Mode: DIO 80MHz
PSRAM: Disabled (Crucial! The code runs in internal RAM).
USB CDC On Boot: Disabled (Use the UART port for upload).
Flash Size: 8MB or 16MB (depending on your board).
Step 4: Upload

Connect USB cable to the port labeled UART (or COM), not the one labeled USB (if your board has two).
If upload fails: Hold BOOT, Press RST, Release BOOT.
Upload Sketch.
